Fecho: an C++ Echo State Network library.

The library is optimised for high-performance realtime use in interactive audio and multimedia scenarios, along with the conventional ML uses for ESNs.

Main.cpp gives examples of use.

Fecho is intended to be cross-platform, but up until now has only been tested on OSX.

There's a Pure Data object in the PD folder.

Future additions may include:

- small world network topology
- multi-frequency techniques
- examples for sound synthesis and audio processing
- testing on windows, linux and iOS.
