This folder contains the source code for a Pure Data extension (http://puredata.info/).  

To compile, do something like this:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

A binary for OSX is in the bin folder, you can install it by copying it into your /Library/Pd folder.  

The code should in theory run cross platform - contributions of binaries for other platforms are welcome.

Try out the help files for examples of use, they should work fine in 'PD Extended'.
